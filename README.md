# LoRaWAN-stack
The LoRaWAN stack adapted for Arduino and a cortex-M0+ in a Freescale KL46Z board.

The 3 types of nodes are working (A, B and C) in both APB and OTT authentication.

The library used for Aduino is the LMIC library with a few adjustments.

For de Freescale we use the LoraMac-node implementation made by Semtech and adapted specially for this microcontroller.
